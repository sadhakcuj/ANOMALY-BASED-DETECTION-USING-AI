# ANOMALY-BASED-DETECTION-USING-AI
AI-powered anomaly detection system that learns normal behavior and flags unusual activity without relying on predefined attack signatures. Uses ML models like Autoencoders and LSTM for real-time threat detection with low false positives and high adaptability.

A modular, intelligent framework for anomaly detection in datasets using modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This repository is designed to help researchers and engineers efficiently detect, visualize, and interpret outlying or abnormal data patterns across applications such as cybersecurity, network intrusion, quality control, fraud detection, and more.

Overview
AI-powered anomaly detection can automatically identify rare or outlier events—such as fraud, attacks, or system failures—that deviate from normal patterns. This project applies a range of both classic and advanced machine learning techniques to spot these anomalies, supporting supervised and unsupervised workflows.

Key Features
Multiple Detection Algorithms: Includes implementations of XGBoost, Autoencoder Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and more for robust anomaly detection.

Extensible Pipeline: Easily plug in new algorithms or datasets for a wide range of anomaly detection tasks.

Explainable AI: Uses methods such as SHAP for interpretability, making model predictions transparent.

Versatile Applications: Can be used for network intrusion detection, fraud analytics, system health monitoring, and more.

Rich Visualization: Built-in scripts for exploring anomalies, model performance, and data distributions.

Customizable Thresholds: Fine-tune detection sensitivity to balance between false positives and missed anomalies.

Jupyter Notebooks & Python Scripts: Interactive and script-based workflows for data exploration and model development.
